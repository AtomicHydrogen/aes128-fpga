Hardware Implementation of an AES-128 Encryption Scheme on a CMOD-A7.

/src contains all hardware and software files.
/eval contains sample benchmarking results on a CMOD-A7 (35T, UART - 115200, 8N1)

This IP can be used independently, but can also be used with a MicroBlaze Soft-core, for which a simple script is provided.
The Benchmarking Script works using the built-in UART of the MicroBlaze but can principally be used with any appropriate interface.
